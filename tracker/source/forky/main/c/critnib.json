  "Description": [
    "ordered map data structure with lock-free reads Critnib is a data structure that provides a very fast equal and less-than/greater-than searches; it is a mix between DJBerstein's critbit and radix trees.  While in bad cases it has worse memory use than binary trees, it works well on real-life data which tends to have a limited number of \"decision bits\": * fully random: divergence happens immediately * malloc addresses: clumps of distinct bits in the middle * sequences: only lowest bits are filled . This library ships only uintptr_tâ†’uintptr_t mappings, optimized for reads from a very critical section but not so frequent writes.  Other variants also exist (such as fully lock-free writes, keys of arbitrary length), and can be added upon request."
