  "Description": [
    "Calculating portfolio returns for Beancount Beangrow contains code which computes investment returns on a variety of assets, as recorded by Beancount, fed directly from a Beancount file. . There are three related scripts: - configure.py: This attempts to automatically infer and generate configuration to compute returns from an existing Beancount ledger. - compute_returns.py: This extracts data for each of the investments defined in the configuration and computes the returns and generates output for each requested returns report. - download_prices.py: The compute_returns.py script outputs a list of missing (or inadequately dated) price directives to properly do its job as a side-product. This script can read that file and fetch those missing dates, which you can insert in your ledger and then rerun compute_returns.py for a more precise calculation."
